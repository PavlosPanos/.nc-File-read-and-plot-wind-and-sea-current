In this script (Jupiter notebook) reads and plots a .NC file (the path is from my personal google drive).

It creates 3 different plots.
One with just the current speed (without draw on any kind of map)
One with just the current speed but this time with a map drawn
And finally a cumulative plot that has the wind speed and the sea current's speed superimposed!!


The area of interest is the Agean sea and this is done as a complimentary help to a colleague of mine
